# 🌱 EcoFi: Tokenized Tree Planting Initiative

## 📖 Introduction
**EcoFi** is a blockchain-based initiative that tokenizes tree planting efforts to promote environmental sustainability.  
This project allows users to sponsor real-world trees and receive NFTs that **grow over time**, ensuring transparency and accountability through **oracles** and **smart contracts**.

## 🌍 Real-World Use Cases
1. **Carbon Credit Tokenization** 🌱: Individuals & corporations can offset their carbon footprint by sponsoring trees.  
2. **Sustainable NFT Utility** 🏆: NFTs dynamically change over time as proof of tree growth.  
3. **DeFi Incentives** 💰: Users can stake tree NFTs to earn passive rewards.  
4. **Oracles for Verification** 🔍: IoT sensors & satellite data verify that trees are actually planted.  
5. **Crowdsourced Reforestation** 🌳: Enables decentralized funding for tree-planting organizations.

## 🔧 How It Works
1. **User sponsors a tree** → Receives an NFT representing the planted tree.  
2. **Oracles verify the tree growth** → IoT sensors & satellite data confirm real-world impact.  
3. **NFTs evolve over time** → Growth stages (seed → sapling → mature tree).  
4. **Users stake NFTs for rewards** → Earn passive income for participating in green initiatives.  
5. **Carbon credits can be traded** → Tokenized proof of carbon absorption.

## 🏗️ Project Construction

### **1️⃣ Smart Contracts (Solidity)**
- `EcoFiTree.sol`: Manages NFT minting, tracking, and evolution.
- `EcoFiStaking.sol`: Handles staking and reward distribution.
- Uses **Chainlink Oracles** for real-world verification.

### **2️⃣ Frontend (React.js)**
- User-friendly interface for **minting, staking, and monitoring tree NFTs**.

### **3️⃣ Backend (Node.js, Hardhat)**
- Handles **contract interactions**, **oracles**, and **database logging**.

### **4️⃣ Blockchain & Storage**
- **Ethereum (Codex Sepolia Testnet)** for NFT transactions.
- **IPFS/Arweave** for metadata storage.
